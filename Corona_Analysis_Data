Data

For this project, I will be using the data from below sources

1. WHO covid website

https://covid19.who.int/info

The site has date wise spread of corona cases for each country. The data will need to be cleansed and required features 
to be selected for doing the analysis. Then need to standardise the data and find out the optimum number of clusters using 
the elbow method. Apply the KMeans clustering method and label countries with similar features.

2. Fousquare API

I will also be using the Fousquare API to find the trending venues in some of the most affected corona country capitals.
